# Cyclecoach

Reads your workout history and data from tss.log generated by [silvercheetah](https://github.com/korganrivera/silvercheetah) and calculates the TSS that is needed day-by-day to achieve optimal fitness while remaining under a given freshness threshold.

Also, uses a formula which correlates TSS with time, speed, and FTP during a workout. With this, it can recommend how long you need to cycle at some speed to achieve today's recommended TSS.
