Horrible ugly code that does exactly what I want right now :)

Reads the tss.log generated by [silvercheetah](https://github.com/korganrivera/silvercheetah) and tells me exactly what TSS I need day-by-day to achieve optimal fitness while remaining under a given freshness threshold.

Also, using my linear regression code, I came up with a formula which correlates TSS with time and speed during a workout. With this, I can recommend how long you need to cycle at some speed to achieve today's recommended TSS. 

This is all rudimentary right now but it's working. Needs more work later. Just getting it up on github.
